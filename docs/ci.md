# GitHub Actions checks and releases

[CI](https://github.com/dk-code-factory/code-factory-plugin/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
runs on pushes to main, pull requests to main and manual dispatch. Feature
branches require an open pull request for automatic verification. Hosted Ubuntu
installs Go from go.mod, Node24, Python3.12, locked npm/Python dependencies and the
matching Playwright Chromium. All actions are pinned to full commit SHAs.

The job validates specifications, checks Go/TypeScript, runs uncached Go race and
browser/accessibility fixtures, tooling, packaging, installer and compiled smoke
tests. It forces fixture mode and needs no model credentials or installed service.
Successful builds upload Linux x86-64 and portable plugin packages, SHA256SUMS and
a CI manifest bound to the exact source commit. Failed browser evidence is kept
separately. Verification has read-only repository permissions.

Main pushes compare their exact before/after commits; PRs compare their event
base/head SHAs. Manual checks use the current parent. Missing or mismatched
commits fail; there is no guessed-ref fallback.
Manual checks can fail when their parent comparison differs from the recorded
reconciliation base.

## Public source import

Personal pilot history, private runtime state and live evidence are not published.
The public repository starts with a reviewed source snapshot, so its root has no
publishable predecessor. The administrator pins that one reviewed root SHA in the
nonsecret CI_BOOTSTRAP_SHA repository variable. Only that exact root on main may
run full structural/build/test/package verification without a nonexistent Git
comparison. It does not perform a fabricated HEAD-to-HEAD check or generate review
decisions. Every later revision uses the ordinary fail-closed specification gate.
The original fourteen-flow historical adoption pin remains unchanged and is not a
public CI bypass; its private historical commit is not published.

## Delivery

[Release](https://github.com/dk-code-factory/code-factory-plugin/actions/workflows/release.yml)
runs when an existing vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH tag is pushed. Manual dispatch on main has
a dry-run option enabled by default; a real delivery requires an existing version
tag. Tags must resolve to main-branch history with a successful **push** run of
CI for that exact SHA and an unexpired package artifact. PR checks or a similarly
named workflow cannot authorize delivery.

The publisher downloads that CI artifact, verifies its commit, filenames, sizes,
checksums and complete asset set, then uploads those same bytes to a GitHub release.
It does not rebuild or overwrite existing releases. Version0 and suffixed tags
publish prereleases. Only the publisher job has contents-write access, using the
built-in short-lived GitHub token. No personal token, SSH key or cloud secret is
needed. CI artifacts expire after30days; rerun their original CI run if necessary.

Deployment to an operator's Linux machine remains manual. No workflow installs
services, changes Tailscale, signs into providers, starts agents or runs live-host
acceptance. A green build does not establish that an installation is ready.
